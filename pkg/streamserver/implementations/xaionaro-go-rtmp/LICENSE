A remark by Dmitrii Okunev:

The initial code of this package was copied from repository
https://github.com/yutopp/go-rtmp of revision 553a888b1af61bc7274aab56e902c1368e26a253.

The content of the LICENSE file is attached above. I had to modify
the code (see the details in the paragraph below), and you are free
to use whatever license you like to use the modifications applied
to this package: CC-0, WTFPL-v2, MIT, or whatever else license.
Any code that I added from scratch is also available under any of
the licenses you prefer.

The reason I had to copy and modify the code, is because I did not
want to just reimplement from scratch all the logic that is provided
in the non-reusable `main` package in the repository.
